# Problem
Remove different kind of comments from strings

# Way to solve
I use state pattern as a main way for solving. 
For each comment variant I created state and implement functionality of what to do  
For each comment-state I have to create a class object. 
Since I do not need more than one class object for each state I used Singleton pattern.
